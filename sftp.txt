# The Ubuntu LTS .iso file can be downloaded from the official Ubuntu website here: https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released
# The .iso file must be flashed to a USB drive using a flash tool like Belena Etcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/
# Use the flashed USB on your target computer to install Ubuntu LTS
# Once installed, open a terminal window with ctrl + alt + t

# Section #2: Installing and configuring SSH

# Start by installing SSH with the following command:

	$ sudo apt install ssh

# Then, create a new SFTP user group:

	$ sudo addgroup sftp

# Now, create your first user:

	$ sudo useradd -m client1 -g sftp

# Set a password for your user

	$ sudo passwd client1:

# Grant the user access to their own directory, but none of the other user's directories using the following:

	$ sudo chmod 700 /home/client1/

# Misc other chmod commands
# chmod 400 file	To protect a file against accidental overwriting.

# chmod 777 file	Everybody can do everything to this file.
